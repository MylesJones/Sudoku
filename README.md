# Sudoku
The goal is to create a webpage that auto generates a sudoku puzzle with (potentially) a difficulty level than can be chosen prior to generating it.
I'm not sure how possible this is, or if it's within my abilities but I thought it would be interesting to try!

I am going to attempt to build the website with NodeJS as I have never used it before, so a lot of my hours code will require me to be learning.
